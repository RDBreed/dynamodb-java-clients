# Purpose
This repository shows a simple demonstration of using the different available DynamoDB Java Clients - namely SDK 1 
or 2 with a low or high level client - when handling a CRUD like entity.
To check this out, you can take a look at the repositories under package eu.luminis.breed.dynamodbmigration.user.
repository or eu.luminis.breed.dynamodbmigration.user.repository.async (sync or async client respectively).
You may run the tests or run the application and perform some API calls...
